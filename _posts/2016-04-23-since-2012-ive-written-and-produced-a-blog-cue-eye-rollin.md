Since 2012, I've written and produced a blog (cue eye-rolling) on the Melbourne suburb of Brunswick. The Brunx was a spearhead in the successful fight to overturn the Moreland City Council's ludicrous policy of replacing historic bluestone laneways with concrete, as well as the reporting on the closure of the Hope Street bus line (since re-opened in 2016). 

Through The Brunx, I covered the Jill Meagher murder (I was the one who located the infamous picture of her murderer, Adrian Bayley), local elections, analysis pieces based on official crime and education data, all the way through to feature pieces and quirky reviews and observational pieces. There are more than 40 articles on the site. 

At its peak, The Brunx received thousands of hits per article but, sadly, I don't get the time to devote as much as I'd like to this little blog. I will probably revisit it in coming months and take it in a new feature style direction and incorporate more multimedia. It may even become a podcast.
